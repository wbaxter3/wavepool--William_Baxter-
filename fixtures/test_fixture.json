		"body": "<p>POLA Deputy Executive Director of Marketing and Customer Relations Michael DiBernardo said at last week's commission meeting that when he started working at the port in 2002, POLA and POLB handled 42% of the nation's containerized imports.\r\n\r\n<p>That number is now 37%, he said. A decline in the market is one of the main reasons the ports are furthering their 14-year collaboration efforts.\r\n\r\n<p>The first step of implementing the MOU will be for port staffs to \"establish a work plan that will prioritize efforts, create work groups and define objectives for each area outlined in the MOU,\" according to the press release. The work plan will be a collaborative effort with shippers and carriers along with stakeholders in labor, drayage and rail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two of the areas, cargo transfer predictability and supply chian connectivity, have presented myriad issues for the entire industry. Outdated scheduling tools and increased urban traffic have necessitated the need for modernization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The San Pedro Bay ports plan to examine process improvements to gate velocity. The Port of Oakland was the first in the nation to experiment with night gate hours to ease long port wait times. Even though the Oakland International Container Terminal charged a $30 fee per load handled at night, the extend hours decreased daytime port congestion, reduced truck traffic, accelerated shipment delivery and boosted truck driver income. One Apex Maritime executive told the port, \"It's the best $30 I ever spent.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MOU also named improving availability of chassis as a focal point of the collaboration agreement, as shortages of the equipment have created issues across supply chains in recent years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visibility, in particular, has been one of ocean freight's pain points, which digitalization is poised to ease. Carriers have been slow to adopt digital tools, though. A Maersk executive likened ocean carriers to dinosaurs when it comes to modernization. But efforts are ongoing across the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA) recently published track and trace standards, aiming to unify information-sharing and further digitization goals. In a DCSA video, Maersk Chief Technology and Information Officer Adam Banks said electronic data exchange is increasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"If we don't do that in a standardized way from the start, the cost of fixing it will be quite high,\" he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collaboration among carriers and between carriers and shippers has long been a challenge that stakeholders are coming to realize must be resolved. But POLA and POLB have been collaborating on solutions to the visibility issue for years, having spearheaded and piloted a federally recommended port information portal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>...</p>",

		"body": "<p>NextGen's Cup Challenge, launched in 2018, has focused on creating a more sustainable and economically sound alternative to traditional beverage containers. Many paper cups in particular are often a challenge to recycle, given their plastic lining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concepts being introduced by two different start-ups take a very different approach to what most consumers currently experience. The Muuse cups in San Francisco come with QR codes and are intended to be scanned upon pick-up and drop-off within five days, with patrons given a 25-cent discount. Failure to return the cups will result in a $15 charge. CupClub models will meanwhile have RFID tags and can be stacked at drop-off points in Palo Alto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"In previous pilots we have achieved a 97% return rate through return incentives and product features in app,\" CupClub founder and CEO Safia Qureshi told Waste Dive. \"We will be keeping a close eye on these metrics during the pilot.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgia Sherwin, a CLP spokesperson, told Waste Dive the Muuse cups are made from powder-coated, double-walled stainless steel, and come with a polypropylene lid and a silicone seal. The CupClub are composed of virgin polypropylene, with low-density polyethylene lids. Both programs will play out over a one-month trial period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pilot programs are limited to two cities, but the NextGen Cup Challenge is seeking a \"moon shot\" attempt to provide solutions for both hot and cold beverage containers on a larger scale. Other members include Coca-Cola, Wendy's, Nestl\u00e9, and Yum! Brands, which owns chains such as KFC and Taco Bell. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>While groups like As You Sow are supportive, MacKerron highlighted the challenges facing efforts to expand the pilot program beyond regions like the Bay Area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"We hope there will be significant trials done in areas that aren\u2019t typically politically progressive to understand better the challenges of making the transition there,\" he said. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new pilot programs come amid a wider shift as industry players face public scrutiny and increasing pressure to meet their climate and environmental goals. Last month, Starbucks announced plans to achieve a 50% reduction in waste sent to landfills from both stores and manufacturing by 2030. The company said it aims to be \"resource-positive\" and the announcement also included a commitment to continuing the NextGen Cup Challenge. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blue Bottle, an upscale coffee chain, meanwhile uses compostable sugarcane cups, but said in 2019 much of that waste still winds up in landfills, contributing to climate change. By the end of 2020, the company is aiming to achieve 90% \"zero waste\" through reusable cups, beginning with a San Francisco-area pilot program. Nestl\u00e9 notably owns a majority stake in the company. </p>\r\n\r\nCompostables remain an attractive alternative for companies seeking sustainable alternatives to single-use.....</p>",

The community has responded well to Publix's customized Miami bag with Miami Beach police spokesperson Ernesto Rodriguez raving about it on Twitter and Twitter user Ramsey Simon tweeted \"Wow, @Publix. You\u2019ve outdone yourselves. This is gorgeous.\u201d</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years the grocer has designed a variety of reusable bags with different logos and custom designs for different holidays and seasons, like Valentine's Day, Easter, spring and summer, Publix said in a recent blog post. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>The push for reusable grocery bags comes as many cities across the country are trying to reduce single-use plastic with regulations, including Miami Beach. According to the Miami Herald, Miami Beach has banned single-use plastic straws, stirrers and plastic bags on beaches, streets, sidewalk cafes and other public places. This law, however, doesn't apply to grocery stores like Publix. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reducing reliance on disposable grocery bags isn\u2019t a new effort for Publix. The grocer has worked to increase the use of reusable bags and decrease paper and plastic since 2007. It even has a live tally on its website of the paper and plastic bags it has saved, now totaling more than 6.8 billion. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Customized reusable grocery bags are a go-to marketing tactic for some grocers over the last several years as consumers move away from plastic. In 2018, Fresh Thyme launched a line of reusable canvas grocery bags unique to each state it operates in. H-E-B is also known for its specially designed commemorative bags, such as its Selena bags.</p>",

Increasingly, though, it's become a hub for manufacturing, particularly in gene therapy, and that proved a draw for Audentes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"It was pretty clear that the Raleigh-Durham area was a front-runner,\" said Audentes' Wuchterl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>News of the investment comes about two and half months after Astellas agreed to buy Audentes for $3 billion, the latest in a string of gene therapy acquisitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manufacturing was one attraction of Astellas to Audentes, and the Japanese drugmaker was aware of the biotech's plans to expand into North Carolina during deal talks, according to Wuchterl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Producing gene therapies requires developers make both the therapeutic DNA as well as the viral shell used to deliver it. For companies developing treatments for neuromuscular diseases, as Audentes is, a one-time dose can comprise billions of viral vectors, making manufacturing a potential bottleneck for both clinical development as well as any subsequent commercialization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contract manufacturers like Lonza, Catalent and Thermo Fisher are an option, and Wuchterl said Audenetes considered whether outsourcing would make sense before ultimately choosing to expand on its own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Audentes' most advanced therapy treats x-linked myotubular myopathy, a rare and usually fatal neuromuscular disease that affects infants and young boys. The biotech is currently making the experimental candidate at its South San Francisco site, but executives sought to backstop supply with another site that could support future growth too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Astellas, which is testing its own gene therapies in preclinical studies, could benefit as well, although that's not the direct aim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"This capacity is needed for Audentes' purposes, but it serves the greater good of the entire combined Astellas-Audentes gene therapy entity that has come to fruition from the acquisition,\" the executive said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction will occur over three phases, Audentes said, the first of which will take place over roughly 18 months. More than 200 jobs will be created in connection with the facility, according to the company.</p>",

But there was one problem: her hair..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"It's not corporate,\" Bowen said she was told. Bowen's hair was in locs, a natural hairstyle, she told HR Dive. It was as if company management was telling her \"you don't quite fit the image that we require here,\" Bowen said. Ultimately, she didn't change her hairstyle and she wasn't offered the position. Instead, she was asked to train her blonde-haired replacement..</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>More than a hairdo issue</h3>\r\n<p>At the time, Bowen had no legal recourse; making employment decisions based on a candidate's hair was and is sometimes legal. But that is changing in some states. In 2019, California became the first state to ban discrimination based on hairstyles by passing the CROWN Act (Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair), which bans policies that discriminate against those with natural hairstyles. New York and New Jersey have also signed their own versions of the Crown Act into law, and it's been introduced in several other states..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's worth noting that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a federal law, does prohibit employers from enacting neutral policies that exclude a protected class of employees. If the test impacts a group of employees based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin, the employer must be able to show the test is job related and consistent with business necessity..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When employers have policies banning employees from wearing certain hairstyles such as locs or a TWA (teeny weeny Afro) to work, it's not just hair discrimination; it's race discrimination, Devjani Mishra, employment law attorney for Littler Mendelson, told HR Dive. Rules that impact people of a particular race is discriminatory in effect, she said. Natural hairstyles are traditionally associated with black people, including African Americans, Africans and Caribbeans, she said..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specific grooming guidelines can discriminate against more than race, Alex Granovsky, a labor and employment attorney at Granovsky & Sundaresh, told HR Dive. Rastafarians and Sikhs also allow their hair to grow naturally, so a grooming policy that prohibits long hair could discriminate against certain religions, he said. Requiring employees to be clean shaven may aggravate skin conditions, resulting in disability discrimination, added Mishra. ....</p>",
